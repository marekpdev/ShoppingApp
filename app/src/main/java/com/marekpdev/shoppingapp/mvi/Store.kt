    // also there is an issue for ProductFragment workflow
    // 1) Store is being initialized ( init{} )
    // 2) ProductViewModel is being initialized (init {}) and sends FetchProduct action
    // 3) Store's coroutineScope launch is being executed and only then actions are being properly read one by one
    // 4) because we sent FetchProduct before the coroutine has been launched and because actions is hot observable
    // then we don't receive the action
    // To make a quick fix for that I set replay = 1 but might need to look into a better solution

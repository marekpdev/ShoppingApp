# ShoppingApp

ShoppingApp is a demo application with the main goal of showcasing best Android development practices and act as a helpful guideline for other developers.

The application is using:
- Custom-made MVI architecture
- Coroutines as the base for asynchronous events processing
- Hilt as a dependency injection framework
- Android Jetpack libraries (such as Navigation components etc)
and other cutting-edge recommended libraries and practices.

The reason why I created this project is because I have noticed that whilst there are countless blog posts about how to apply best practices for Android development, there are not that many fully-fledged open source applications that show how these best practices actually come together. I wanted to bridge this gap and provide a helpful learning tool for other Android developers.

***Please bear in mind that the project itself is still a work-in-progress - it contains many hardcoded workflows that are only used for debugging and that are yet to be replaced with actual workflows/fields/data***
